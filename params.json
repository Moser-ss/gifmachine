{"name":"gifmachine","tagline":"a better way to waste time with gifs (at work).","body":"### the story\r\ngifmachine was born out of a computer at [Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/careers) that, for a few days, just showed a gif of a helicopter spinning upside down. The gif resonated with the software engineers, evoking a sense of confusion and 'wtf' that unified us. When the computer went missing, pseudo-anger filled us all. We pledged to avenge our loss by creating a gifmachine greater than the one so wrongly taken from us.\r\n\r\n### the real story\r\nWe stole a telepresence computer for a few days and played gifs on it. We liked it so much that when the rolling telepresence computer went back to its intended use, I wasted a bunch of time making a replacement so that as a team we could all continue wasting time wasting other people's time. Then we open-sourced it so you can waste time too!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*A Machine for Gifs*\r\n\r\n- Need an excuse to show a gif to your coworkers? \r\n- Need a use for that Raspberry Pi that isn't doing anything useful?\r\n- Need a web-scale solution to your animated gif needs?\r\n\r\nPresenting the newest GMaaS (Gif Machine as a Service) solution for your tech company with a startup culture: **gifmachine**\r\n\r\n![billion dollar startup idea](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wolfd/gifmachine/master/info/gifmachine-1.gif)\r\n\r\nWhat actually is it?\r\n--------------------\r\n- gifmachine is a Ruby Sinatra app that provides a dirty interface for enjoying gifs with your coworkers. gifmachine provides a HTTP API for posting gifs and meme text to overlay.\r\n- gifmachine allows your coworkers to complain about `company_x`'s broken API when it goes down and laugh as [the internet catches fire](http://istheinternetonfire.com/).\r\n- gifmachine is designed to be run in kiosk mode on an unused computer and monitor, it's just a webpage that puts the gif meme in fullscreen.\r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\n-----------------\r\nIt mostly does! When it is working well...\r\n- gifmachine uses WebSockets to send out updates to connected clients.\r\n- gifmachine stores everything in a database (developed with Postgres, but it shouldn't be too hard to change that).\r\n- gifmachine uses ActiveRecord to save the developer time and calories.\r\n\r\nWebSockets?\r\n-----------\r\n![websockets are magic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wolfd/gifmachine/master/info/gifmachine-2.gif)\r\n\r\nOkay I want this, what do?\r\n----------\r\n1. Get [RVM](http://rvm.io/rvm/install)\r\n2. Using RVM, install Ruby 2.1.2 `rvm install 2.1.2`\r\n3. Run `bundle install`\r\n4. Get Postgres `sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib`\r\n5. [If using Ubuntu Server 14.04 you might need to install `libpq-dev` for bundler to work](http://stackoverflow.com/a/6040822/831768)\r\n6. `sudo -u postgres createuser -D -A -P gifmachine` and enter in a good password\r\n7. `sudo -u postgres createdb -O gifmachine gifmachine` \r\n8. Change `config/database.yml` to reflect the username and password of your gifmachine database\r\n9. `rake db:schema:load` to load the database schema into the database\r\n10. Change the API password (:gifmachine_password) in app.rb to something else\r\n11. `rackup`\r\n12. Enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\nUh, how do I post gifs?\r\n-----------------------\r\nHere's a relevant snippet of Ruby code that might help you interface with gifmachine's API:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nEventMachine::HttpRequest.new(\"#{@config.base_url}/gif\", options).post :body => {\r\n  :url => gif_url,\r\n  :who => username,\r\n  :meme_top => meme_top,\r\n  :meme_bottom => meme_bottom,\r\n  :seekrit => @config.password # Minimal security lololol\r\n}\r\n```","google":"UA-56317076-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
